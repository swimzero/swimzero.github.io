# Self Introduce Page (2023.08.14~08.17)

### Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I learned through online lectures. 

I also referenced a senior’s self-introduction page code for inspiration. (I hope it’s not considered plagiarism! ><)

### Challenges

- No matter how much I worked on it, my design didn’t quite match up to my senior’s page. Eventually, I ended up following their code closely and just changed the content.

Solutions & Limitations

- However, I now fully understand the code, and I added a scroll button to make it stand out in my own way.

### Reflections & Future Goals

- I had so much fun working on this project that I shared the URL on my social media.
- I’ll keep updating this webpage with my experiences, maybe even forever!
- To remember my first development project, I won’t change the code—only the content.
